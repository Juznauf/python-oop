    "#### Calling Superclass Constructors\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are normally called through instances. Calls to methods through a class, though, do show up in a variety of special roles. One common scenario involves the constructor method. The `__init__` method, like all attributes, is looked up by inheritance. This means that at construction time, Python locates and calls just one `__init__`. If subclass constructors need to guarantee that superclass construction-time logic runs, too, they generally must call the superclass’s `__init__` method explicitly through the class: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    \n",
    "class Sub(Super):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, x, y):\n",
    "        Super.__init__(self,x) # Run superclass __init__\n",
    "        ....custom code...   # Do my custom init for this class\n",

    "Inheritor : Doesn’t provide any new names, so it gets everything defined in Super.\n",
    "Replacer : Overrides Super’s method with a version of its own.\n",
    "Extender : Customizes Super’s method by overriding and calling back to run the default. \n",
    "Provider : Implements the action method expected by Super’s delegate method. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### abstract superclasses\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the prior example’s classes, Provider may be the most crucial to understand. When we call the delegate method through a Provider instance, two independent inheritance searches occur: \n",
    "1. On the initial x.delegate call, Python finds the delegate method in Super by searching the Provider instance and above. The instance x is passed into the method’s self argument as usual. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inside the Super.delegate method, self.action invokes a new, independent inheritance search of self and above. Because self references a Provider instance, the action method is located in the Provider subclass. \n",
    "\n",
    "At least in terms of the delegate method, the superclass in this example is what is sometimes called an abstract superclass—a class that expects parts of its behavior to be provided by its subclasses. If an expected method is not defined in a subclass, Python raises an undefined name exception when the inheritance search fails. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Class coders sometimes make such subclass requirements more obvious with assert statements, or by raising the built-in NotImplementedError exception with raise statements. We’ll study statements that may trigger exceptions in depth in the next part of this book; as a quick preview, here’s the assert scheme in action: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class Super:\n",
    "    def delegate(self):\n",
    "        self.action()\n",
    "    def action(self):\n",
    "        assert False, 'action must be defined!' # if this version is called\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the expression is always false so as to trigger an error message if a method is not redefined, and inheritance locates the version here. Alternatively, some classes simply raise a `NotImplementedError` exception directly in such method stubs to signal the mistake:\n",
    "\n",

    "### Operator Overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "Really “operator overloading” simply means intercepting built-in operations in a class’s methods—Python automatically invokes your methods when instances of the class appear in built-in operations, and your method’s return value becomes the result of the corresponding operation. Here’s a review of the key ideas behind overloading: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Operator overloading lets classes intercept normal Python operations. \n",
    "- Classes can overload all Python expression operators. \n",
    "- Classes can also overload built-in operations such as printing, function calls, attribute access, etc. \n",
    "- Overloading makes class instances act more like built-in types. \n",
    "- Overloading is implemented by providing specially named methods in a class."
