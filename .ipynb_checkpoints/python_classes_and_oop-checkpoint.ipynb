For instance, for our robot to be successful, it might need arms to roll dough, motors to maneuver to the oven, and so on. In OOP parlance, our robot is an example of composition; it contains other objects that it activates to do its bidding. Each component might be coded as a class, which defines its own behavior and relationships. \n"

    "    def giveRaise(self):...\n",
    "    def promote(self):...\n",
    "    def retire(self):...\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once you’ve coded this general behavior, you can specialize it for each specific kind of employee to reflect how the various types differ from the norm. That is, you can code subclasses that customize just the bits of behavior that differ per employee type; the rest of the employee types’ behavior will be inherited from the more general class. For example, if engineers have a unique salary computation rule (perhaps it’s not hours times rate), you can replace just that one method in a subclass: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class Engineer(Employee):\n",
    "    def computeSalary(self):... \n",

    "because the computeSalary version here appears lower in the class tree, it will replace (override) the general version in Employee. You then create instances of the kinds of employee classes that the real employees belong to, to get the correct behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism means that the meaning of an operation depends on the object being operated on. That is, code shouldn’t care about what an object is, only about what it does. Here, the method computeSalary is located by inheritance search in each object before it is called. The net effect is that we automatically run the correct version for the object being processed. Trace the code to see why\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In other applications, polymorphism might also be used to hide (i.e., encapsulate) interface differences. For example, a program that processes data streams might be coded to expect objects with input and output methods, without caring what those methods actually do: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "def processor(reader, converter, writer):\n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "        data = reader.read()\n",
    "        if not data:\n",

    "        data = converter(data)\n",
    "        writer.write(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "By passing in instances of subclasses that specialize the required read and write method interfaces for various data sources, we can reuse the processor function for any data source we need to use, both now and in the future: \n",

After running a class statement, class attributes are accessed by name qualification: object.name. \n",

    "#### Overloading operators\n",
    "1. Methods named with double underscores `(__X__)` are special hooks. In Python classes we implement operator overloading by providing specially named methods to intercept operations. The Python language defines a fixed and unchangeable mapping from each of these operations to a specially named method. \n",
    "2. Such methods are called automatically when instances appear in built-in operations. For instance, if an instance object inherits an `__add__` method, that method is called whenever the object appears in a + expression. The method’s return value becomes the result of the corresponding expression. \n",
    "3. Classes may override most built-in type operations. There are dozens of special operator overloading method names for intercepting and implementing nearly every operation available for built-in types. This includes expressions, but also basic operations like printing and object creation. \n",
    "4. There are no defaults for operator overloading methods, and none are required. If a class does not define or inherit an operator overloading method, it just means that the corresponding operation is not supported for the class’s instances. If there is no `__add__`, for example, + expressions raise exceptions. \n",
    "5.  Operators allow classes to integrate with Python’s object model. By overloading type operations, the user-defined objects we implement with classes can act just like built-ins, and so provide consistency as well as compatibility with expected interfaces. \n",

    "As a next step, then, let’s put OOP’s methodology to use and customize our Person class by extending our software hierarchy. For the purpose of this tutorial, we’ll define a subclass of Person called Manager that replaces the inherited giveRaise method with a more specialized version. Our new class begins as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Manager(Person):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This inherits from person, a manager is almost similar to a person, except that when a manager gets a raise, its recieves the passed-in percentage as usual but also gets an extra bonus that defaults to 10%. For instance if a managers raise is specified as 10%, it will really get 20%\n",
    "\n",
    "Our new method begins as follows, because this redefinition of giveRaise is closer in the class tree to Manager instances than the original version in Person, it effectively replaces, and thereby customizes the operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there are two ways we might code this Manager customization, a good way and a bad way. Lets start with the bad way, since it might be a bit easier to understand. The bad way is to cut and paste the code of giveRaise in Person and modify it for Manager, like this\n",

    "```python\n",
    "class Manager(Person):\n",
    "    def giveRaise(self, percent, bonus=0.10):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem here is a general one, everytime you copy code with cut and paste, you essentially double your maintanence effort in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Augmenting methods the good way\n",
    "\n",
    "What we really want to do here is somehow augment the original giveRaise, instead of replacing it altogether. The good way to do that in Python is by calling to the original version directly, with augmented arguments, like this:\n",

    "```python \n",

    "        Person.giveRaise(self, percent + bonus)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code leverages the fact that a class methods can always be called either through an instance (the usual ways, where Python sends the instance to the self argument automatically) or through the class(the less common scheme, where you must pass the instance manually). In more symbolic terms, recall that a normal method call of this form:\n",

    "### Using introspection to check for object attributes\n",
    "We can put these interfaces to work in a superclass that displays accurate class names and formats all attributes of an instance of any class. Open a new file in your text editor to code the following—it’s a new, independent module named classtools.py that implements just such a class. Because its __repr__ display overload uses generic introspection tools, it will work on any instance, regardless of the instance’s attributes set. And because this is a class, it automatically becomes a general formatting tool: thanks to inheritance, it can be mixed into any class that wishes to use its display format. As an added bonus, if we ever want to change how instances are displayed we need only change this class, as every class that inherits its `__repr__` will automatically pick up the new format when it’s next run: \n",
