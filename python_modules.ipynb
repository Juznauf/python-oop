Top level files use tools defined in module files,and modules use tools defined in other modules. \n",

    "### Comparison between python imports and header files of C\n",
    "Python imports are runtime operations that perform three distinct steps the first time a program imports a given file:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the modules file\n",
    "    - Uses the python search path method\n",
    "    - can also use the python package `package imports` from stdlib\n",
    "2. Compile it to byte code (if needed)\n",
    "    - byte code files are stored in `__pycache__` subdirectory\n",
    "    - while top level files are often designed to be executed, it is possible to design a file that servess both as the top level code of a program and as a module of tools to be imported. Such a file may be both executed and imported, and thus does generate a .pyc file. This is done by using __name__ and __main__\n",
    "3. Run the modules code to build the object it defines\n",
    "    - All the tools (def statements) defined by the modules code are created. \n",
    "    - If you need to import a file again after it has already been loaded , you have to force the issue with an `imp.reload` call.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three steps are carried out only the first time a module is imported. Python stores loaded modules in a table named `sys.modules` and checking there at the start of an import operation. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. The home directory of the program\n",
    "2. `PYTHONPATH` directories (if set)\n",
    "3. Standard library directories\n",
    "4. The contents of any *.pth* files (if present)\n",
    "5. The *site-packages* home of third party extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "The concatenation of these four components become **sys.path**, a mutable list of directory names strings\n",

    "\n",
    "By modifying the sys.path list, you can modify the search path for all future imports made in a programs run. Such changes last only for the duration of the script, however; PYTHONPATH and .pth files offer more permanent ways to modify the path-the first per user, and the second per installation"
