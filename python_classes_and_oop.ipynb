    "Inheritence: Pizza-making robots are kinds of robots, so they possess the usual robot-y properties. In OOP terms, we say they “inherit” properties from the general category of all robots. These common properties need to be implemented only once for the general case and can be reused in part or in full by all types of robots we may build in the future\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition: Pizza-making robots are really collections of components that work together as a team. For instance, for our robot to be successful, it might need arms to roll dough, motors to maneuver to the oven, and so on. In OOP parlance, our robot is an example of composition; it contains other objects that it activates to do its bidding. Each component might be coded as a class, which defines its own behavior and relationships. \n"

    "#### Polymorphism and classes\n",
    "As an example, suppose you’re assigned the task of implementing an employee database application. As a Python OOP programmer, you might begin by coding a general superclass that defines default behaviors common to all the kinds of employees in your organization: \n",

    "```python \n",
    "class Employee:\n",
    "    def computeSalary(self):...\n",
    "    def giveRaise(self):...\n",
    "    def promote(self):...\n",
    "    def retire(self):...\n",
    "```\n",
    "Once you’ve coded this general behavior, you can specialize it for each specific kind of employee to reflect how the various types differ from the norm. That is, you can code subclasses that customize just the bits of behavior that differ per employee type; the rest of the employee types’ behavior will be inherited from the more general class. For example, if engineers have a unique salary computation rule (perhaps it’s not hours times rate), you can replace just that one method in a subclass: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class Engineer(Employee):\n",
    "    def computeSalary(self):... \n",
    "```\n",
    "because the computeSalary version here appears lower in the class tree, it will replace (override) the general version in Employee. You then create instances of the kinds of employee classes that the real employees belong to, to get the correct behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism means that the meaning of an operation depends on the object being operated on. That is, code shouldn’t care about what an object is, only about what it does. Here, the method computeSalary is located by inheritance search in each object before it is called. The net effect is that we automatically run the correct version for the object being processed. Trace the code to see why\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In other applications, polymorphism might also be used to hide (i.e., encapsulate) interface differences. For example, a program that processes data streams might be coded to expect objects with input and output methods, without caring what those methods actually do: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "def processor(reader, converter, writer):\n",
    "    while True:\n",
    "        data = reader.read()\n",
    "        if not data:\n",
    "            break\n",
    "        data = converter(data)\n",
    "        writer.write(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "By passing in instances of subclasses that specialize the required read and write method interfaces for various data sources, we can reuse the processor function for any data source we need to use, both now and in the future: \n",

When reached and run, it generates a new class object and assigns it to the name in the class header. Also, like defs, class statements typically run when the files they are coded in are first imported. \n",

Just like in module files, top-level assignments within a class statement (not nested in a def) generate attributes in a class object. Technically, the class statement defines a local scope that morphs into the attribute namespace of the class object, just like a module’s global scope. After running a class statement, class attributes are accessed by name qualification: object.name. \n",

    "#### Overloading operators\n",
    "1. Methods named with double underscores `(__X__)` are special hooks. In Python classes we implement operator overloading by providing specially named methods to intercept operations. The Python language defines a fixed and unchangeable mapping from each of these operations to a specially named method. \n",
    "2. Such methods are called automatically when instances appear in built-in operations. For instance, if an instance object inherits an `__add__` method, that method is called whenever the object appears in a + expression. The method’s return value becomes the result of the corresponding expression. \n",
    "3. Classes may override most built-in type operations. There are dozens of special operator overloading method names for intercepting and implementing nearly every operation available for built-in types. This includes expressions, but also basic operations like printing and object creation. \n",
    "4. There are no defaults for operator overloading methods, and none are required. If a class does not define or inherit an operator overloading method, it just means that the corresponding operation is not supported for the class’s instances. If there is no `__add__`, for example, + expressions raise exceptions. \n",
    "5.  Operators allow classes to integrate with Python’s object model. By overloading type operations, the user-defined objects we implement with classes can act just like built-ins, and so provide consistency as well as compatibility with expected interfaces. \n",
