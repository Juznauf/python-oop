### Introduction

As I aim to reach a certain level of mastery with Python, keyword is *try*, there is no escaping the tranches of object oriented programming (OOP). OOP allows to extend the power of procedural programming by performing abstractions and adds to code reusability, same way that functional programming does, except that we are able to extend it to a whole new world, where objects interact with one another, and properties extend beyond basic operations. I hope that by the end of this repo, I will attain a level of mastery in python that will allow me to write meaningful APIs as well as use frameworks that leverage on the power of OOP.

### Progress

- Finished Python namespace, scopes, generators (see `functions_and_generators.py` and `python_scopes.ipynb`)


### Issues

- For ipynb files in vscode, in order for image to render, reopen the notebook.
